## My Process

I developed this QR code generator as a personal project to learn more about QR code generation and to provide a simple and user-friendly tool for creating QR codes users can download the generated QR code as an image file for easy sharing and printing.

### Built With

- Technologies Used: HTML5 and CSS3: For creating the user interface and styling the application.

- JavaScript: For handling form submission, QR code generation using the qrcodejs library, and user feedback animations.

- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework used to style the application components.

- QRCode.js: A lightweight JavaScript library used for generating QR codes based on the user's input.

### What I Learned

During the development of this project, I gained valuable experience in the following areas:

- QR code generation and encoding
- DOM manipulation with JavaScript
- User interface design and user experience considerations
- Version control using Git and GitHub

### Continued Development

Web QR-Code Generator The Web QR-Code Generator is a simple web application that allows users to generate QR codes based on a URL input. It provides a convenient way to create QR codes that can be scanned by smartphones and other QR code readers.

Features: Input a URL: Users can enter any valid URL in the input field to generate a corresponding QR code.

Select QR Code Size: The application provides a dropdown menu that allows users to choose the size of the generated QR code. Available size options include 100x100, 200x200, and 300x300 pixels.

Visual Feedback: When the user submits an empty URL, the application displays a shake animation on the input field to provide visual feedback for invalid input.

Loader Animation: While the QR code is being generated, a loader animation is displayed to indicate that the process is in progress.

Save QR Code Image: Once the QR code is generated, a "Save Image" button appears, enabling users to download the QR code image in PNG format.

While this QR code generator is functional, there are several ways it can be improved and expanded:

- **Additional QR Code Types:** Add support for generating different types of QR codes, such as vCard, calendar events, and more.

- **Customization Options:** Allow users to customize the appearance of the QR code, such as color and size.

- **Error Handling:** Implement error handling to provide clear feedback to users when invalid data is entered.

- **Mobile-Friendly Design:** Optimize the user interface for mobile devices to ensure a seamless experience on smartphones and tablets.

### How To Use

- Clone the repository to your local machine.

- Open the index.html file in your web browser.

- Enter a valid URL in the input field.

- Choose the desired QR code size from the dropdown menu.

- Click the "Generate QR" button to create the QR code.

- Once the QR code is generated, you can download it by clicking the "Save Image" button.
